      "message": "Hi,\nI think sdlpy is a wrong place to add this kind of RNIB specific functionality. Sdlpy is and it should be common \"library\" what offers common APIs to set,get and remove key-values from database, it should not offer any use-case specific interfaces, like rnib to anyone.\nInstead, should we have for example a new repository \"nodeb-rnib-py\" what provides APIs like \u0027get_list_gnb_ids\u0027 and \u0027get_list_enb_ids\u0027 and in implementation of these APIs we utilize sdlpy common APIs to read (rnib) key-values from database.\nThis is just my view, waiting others to comment too.\nRegards,\nTimo ",
