"""
Examples how to use synchronous API functions of the Shareddatalayer.
Execution of  these examples requires:
 * Following Redis extension commands have been installed to runtime environment:
   - MSETPUB
   - SETIE
   - SETIEPUB
   - SETNXPUB
   - DELPUB
   - DELIE
   - DELIEPUB
   Redis v4.0 or greater is required. Older versions do not support extension modules.
   Implementation of above commands is produced by RIC DBaaS:
   https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/admin/repos/ric-plt/dbaas
   In official RIC deployments these commands are installed by `dbaas` service to Redis
   container(s).
   In development environment you may want install commands manually to pod/container, which is
   running Redis.
 * Following environment variables are needed to set to the pod/container where the application
   utilizing SDL is going to be run.
     DBAAS_SERVICE_HOST = [redis server address]
     DBAAS_SERVICE_PORT= [redis server port]
     DBAAS_MASTER_NAME = [master Redis sentinel name]. Needed to set only if sentinel is in use.
     DBAAS_SERVICE_SENTINEL_PORT = [Redis sentinel port number]. Needed to set only if sentinel
     is in use.
